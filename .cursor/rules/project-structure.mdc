# Project Structure Guide

This project is an Android application with the following main structure:

- The main application code is in [app/src/main/java/com/bearmod/loader/](mdc:app/src/main/java/com/bearmod/loader).
- UI layouts and resources are in [app/src/main/res/](mdc:app/src/main/res).
- App configuration and build scripts are in [app/build.gradle.kts](mdc:app/build.gradle.kts) and [build.gradle.kts](mdc:build.gradle.kts).
- Product flavors, authentication, and OTA logic are organized in subdirectories under the main Java package.
- Documentation and implementation summaries are in the project root as Markdown files (e.g., [README.md](mdc:README.md), [IMPLEMENTATION_SUMMARY.md](mdc:IMPLEMENTATION_SUMMARY.md)).

## Key Entry Points
- The main application class is [KeyAuthLoaderApplication.kt](mdc:app/src/main/java/com/bearmod/loader/KeyAuthLoaderApplication.kt).
- The main activity is [MainActivity.kt](mdc:app/src/main/java/com/bearmod/loader/ui/MainActivity.kt).
- Authentication logic is in [KeyAuthRepository.kt](mdc:app/src/main/java/com/bearmod/loader/data/repository/KeyAuthRepository.kt) and [AuthViewModel.java](mdc:app/src/main/java/com/bearmod/loader/viewmodel/AuthViewModel.java).
- OTA update logic is in [OTARepository.kt](mdc:app/src/main/java/com/bearmod/loader/data/repository/OTARepository.kt) and related files.

## Notes
- Follow the [Test and Example File Cleanup Guide](mdc:cleanup-tests.mdc) for keeping the codebase tidy.
- Use the documentation in the root and [docs/](mdc:docs) directory for implementation details and guides.

This rule helps new contributors quickly understand the layout and main files of the Bear-Loader project.
