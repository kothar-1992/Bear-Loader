# Resource and Asset Management Guide

- Place images and icons in [res/drawable/](mdc:app/src/main/res/drawable) or appropriate mipmap folders for launcher icons.
- Use [res/values/](mdc:app/src/main/res/values) for colors, strings, and styles.
- Reference resources in code using R (e.g., R.drawable.bear_icon, R.string.app_name).
- Organize resources by type and purpose for clarity.
- Keep resource names descriptive and consistent.

This ensures assets are easy to find and use throughout the project.
