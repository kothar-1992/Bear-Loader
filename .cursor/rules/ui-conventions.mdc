# UI, Fragment, and Activity Conventions

- Place new activities and fragments in [ui/](mdc:app/src/main/java/com/bearmod/loader/ui) and subdirectories.
- Layout XML files go in [res/layout/](mdc:app/src/main/res/layout).
- Use ViewModel for business logic and LiveData/StateFlow for UI state.
- For navigation, use explicit intents for activities and fragment transactions for fragments.
- Handle language changes by updating UI text and, if needed, recreating the activity (see [EnhancedSettingsFragment.kt](mdc:app/src/main/java/com/bearmod/loader/ui/fragments/EnhancedSettingsFragment.kt)).
- Keep UI responsive and follow Material Design guidelines.

Follow these conventions for consistency and maintainability.
